TO DO:
1. name of policy should match description in first paragraph

x Done.  2. add link to external Digitization Resources (rather than bundling them into this policy document). Distribution / Sharing policy does not have room to include Digitization, Archiving, etc. advice for all of these different types of media.

3. iDigBio is not an image archive and does not provide archival storage. Institutions should be archiving images in accorance with their institutional policies. - pointer to archiving

4. Did we want to include anything on Licensing in this policy? -yes  (pointer to Intellectual Property document)

x 5. complete the acceptable formats, mime types, etc. section by replacing. --moved to wiki

6. rework "Fit for Display" section

x Not sure why this was listed as item for the media policy.  7. Include link to not-yet-existent document about proper use / sample distribution via Audubon Core? Or include section in this document?

x Nothing has surfaced in the years since the policy re-write was initiated other than 3D models.  8. Do we know if the community already has piles of Unsupported Types that iDigBio should reconsider supporting or adding to future plans?

9. Important of Metadata, searching and display for Discovery

10. iDigBio will create derivatives for display in the iDigBio search portal and attempt to display in the portal only those media that meet our fit for display criteria




iDigBio Media File Format Requirements and Recommendations

** original:
iDigBio’s mission requires that it be able to aggregate and distribute digital media of biological specimens, records, and other objects associated with specimens (e.g., labels and notes) generated by TCNs and other bio- and paleo-collections hosting institutions. This document provides current iDigBio policy and guidelines for distributing digitial media such as images, audio, 3D models, and other types of media.



** in-progress 
iDigBio’s mission requires the aggregation of digital information associated with museum specimens.  Digital information includes specimen occurrence records, media, and other related digital objects. media of biological specimens, records, and other objects associated with specimens (e.g., labels and notes) generated by TCNs and other bio- and paleo-collections hosting institutions. This document provides current iDigBio policy and guidelines for distributing digitial media such as images, audio, 3D models, and other types of media.

The discoverability and usability of media is directly related to the richeness and accuracy of metadata provided with the media. Media records, Audubon Core, ....


Specifications and guidelines for digital media should come from specialists in the preservation of digital formats such as the Library of Congress, or the community of practice respective to the media type.



This requirements will evolve over time as technologies change and with input from the scientific community. If you are a data provider with media types that are not listed as acceptable formats, please feel free to contact iDigBio at data@idigbio.org.





The ... policy is as follows:

* Compression: All media submitted must be internally compressed, and that compression should attempt to maximize compression without sacrificing media quality. For most media types, a lossy compression algorithm would be employed to achieve this balance. For 3D models, reducing the object complexity or number of polygons (by smoothing or optimizing mesh quality) can help achieve the same goal.

* Unacceptable media formats: Proprietary formats and codecs or formats that are not readable with widely available free or open-source software and libraries. This includes but is not limited to: DNG, RAW, PSD, TIFF, FLAC, GIF, FLV, SWF, AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Microsoft DOCX.


Lossless?  Has to do with source of images and inevitably making better lower quality derivatives.
* Recommended image formats: The following formats are recommended: JPEG/JPEG2000 with fully preserved Metadata (EXIF and others). We prefer images generated with lossless compression at the camera’s native resolution, or very high quality lossy compression if the workflow doesn’t permit lossless (see recommendations below).  There may be other formats that iDigBio will accept besides the types mentioned above.

* Primary storage: iDigBio accepts images for the purpose of aggregation, discovery, and display in the iDigBio portal and retrieved via the iDigBio API. This assumes that data and media providers maintain the source media. iDigBio is not currently funded by NSF to be primary storage for specimen images. iDigBio is not a file server for collection media.

* Archival storage: iDigBio accepts images for the purpose of aggregation, discovery, and display in the iDigBio portal and retrieved via the iDigBio API. Archival storage by definition includes the notion of long-term media preservation. iDigBio is not currently funded by NSF to provide archival storage. iDigBio is not a data backup system for collection media. Museum collections and media providers should archive digitial media in accorance with their institutional policies and data management plans.


Image Distribution Recommendations
Images uploaded to aggregators and portals should be ‘fit for display’.
Lower quality images should be distributed to aggregators and portals only when there is no higher quality image available.
When a low quality image is uploaded or distributed, the metadata for that image should indicate that it is the only image available for that specimen. (is this really necessary??)
JPEG format at native resolution and minimal compression is preferred for distribution via the internet.
Lossless compression is preferred.
When lossless compression is not an option, lossy compression at the lowest level is preferred.





Intellectual Property and Data Licensing

iDigBio has established an Intellectual Property Policy related to the presentation of content provided by collections and institutions:

Digitization Resources

iDigBio Digitization Resources are available at:

Glossary / Appendix

“Fit for Display” - This is a term that relates to suitabiliy of items to be shared on the Internet. This takes into account native web browser support to view/render the content as well as the capability to load the content over modest Internet connections. Specialized proprietary media formats and archival quality digitization outputs are not Fit for Display since these media would not be readily consumable. iDigBio reads and generates derivatives of media that are Fit for Display only.

=============================================

Unsupported formats: DNG, RAW, PSD, TIFF, and proprietary formats that are not readable with widely available free or open-source software.
Recommended formats: While iDigBio will accept all formats that are not listed above as unacceptable, the following formats are recommended: JPEG/JPEG2000 with fully preserved Metadata (EXIF and others). We prefer images generated with lossless compression at the camera’s native resolution, or very high quality lossy compression if the workflow doesn’t permit lossless. (see recommendations below)
Archival storage: iDigBio sees the importance of archival storage although currently does not provide any, and hosting of images in iDigBio should not be seen as such. As the current iDigBio NSF agreement does not fund archival storage, within current resource limitations, iDigBio may be able to facilitate storage of images on a case-by-case basis.

**** lossless JPEG actually not supported in iDigBio image ingestion, so lossless contents should be removed.  lossless format is borderline mutually exclusive with our definition of "fit for display". - Dan ***


**** Alex note - GBIF "Multimedia" extension is not AC
According to http://www.gbif.org/resource/80697 there are six mandatory terms for AC:
