TO DO:
1. name of policy should match description in first paragraph
2. add link to external Digitization Resources (rather than bundling them into this policy document). Distribution / Sharing policy does not have room to include Digitization, Archiving, etc. advice for all of these different types of media.
3. iDigBio is not an image archive and does not provide archival storage. Institutions should be archiving images in accorance with their institutional policies.
4. Did we want to include anything on Licensing in this policy?  (pointer to Intellectual Property document)
5. complete the acceptable formats, mime types, etc. section by replacing **** TBD ****
6. rework "Fit for Display" section
7. Include link to not-yet-existent document about proper use / sample distribution via Audubon Core? Or include section in this document?
8. Do we know if the community already has piles of Unsupported Types that iDigBio should reconsider supporting or adding to future plans?
9. ??



iDigBio Media File Format Requirements and Recommendations

iDigBio’s mission requires that it be able to aggregate and distribute digital media of biological specimens, records, and other objects associated with specimens (e.g., labels and notes) generated by TCNs and other bio- and paleo-collections hosting institutions. This document provides current iDigBio policy and guidelines for distributing digitial media such as images, audio, 3D models, and other types of media.

This requirements will evolve over time as technologies change and with input from the scientific community. If you are a data provider with media types that are not listed as acceptable formats, please feel free to contact iDigBio at data@idigbio.org.

The current policy is as follows:

* Compression: All media submitted must be internally compressed, and that compression should attempt to maximize compression without sacrificing media quality. For most media types, a lossy compression algorithm would be employed to achieve this balance. For 3D models, reducing the object complexity or number of polygons (by smoothing or optimizing mesh quality) can help achieve the same goal.

* Unacceptable media formats: Proprietary or formats that are not readable with widely available free or open-source software and libraries. This includes but is not limited to: DNG, RAW, PSD, TIFF, FLAC, GIF, FLV, SWF, AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Microsoft DOCX.


Lossless?  Has to do with source of images and inevitably making better lower quality derivatives.
* Recommended image formats: The following formats are recommended: JPEG/JPEG2000 with fully preserved Metadata (EXIF and others). We prefer images generated with lossless compression at the camera’s native resolution, or very high quality lossy compression if the workflow doesn’t permit lossless (see recommendations below).  There may be other formats that iDigBio will accept besides the types mentioned above.

* Primary storage: iDigBio accepts images for the purpose of aggregation, discovery, and display in the iDigBio portal and retrieved via the iDigBio API. iDigBio is not currently funded by NSF to be primary storage for specimen images. iDigBio is not a file server for collection media.

* Archival storage: iDigBio accepts images for the purpose of aggregation, discovery, and display in the iDigBio portal and retrieved via the iDigBio API. Archival storage includes the propertyof long-term media preservation. iDigBio is not currently funded by NSF to provide archival storage. iDigBio is not a data backup system for collection media.


Image Distribution Recommendations
Images uploaded to aggregators and portals should be ‘fit for display’.
Lower quality images should be distributed to aggregators and portals only when there is no higher quality image available.
When a low quality image is uploaded or distributed, the metadata for that image should indicate that it is the only image available for that specimen. (is this really necessary??)
JPEG format at native resolution and minimal compression is preferred for distribution via the internet.
Lossless compression is preferred.
When lossless compression is not an option, lossy compression at the lowest level is preferred.

Intellectual Property and Data Licensing

iDigBio has established an Intellectual Property Policy related to the presentation of content provided by collections and institutions.

Glossary / Appendix

*** This is changing as more browsers add native support, HTML5 media elements, etc. Also, browser plugins are  ***
*** available for almost every media type these days (such as TIFF).                                            ***
*** - Dan
“Fit for Display” - This is a term that relates to suitabiliy of items to be shared on the Internet. This takes into account native web browser support to view/render the content as well as the capability to load the content over modest Internet connections. Specialized proprietary media formats and archival quality digitization outputs are not Fit for Display since these media would not be readily consumable. iDigBio reads and generates derivatives of media that are Fit for Display only.

=============================================

Unacceptable formats: DNG, RAW, PSD, TIFF, and proprietary formats that are not readable with widely available free or open-source software.
Recommended formats: While iDigBio will accept all formats that are not listed above as unacceptable, the following formats are recommended: JPEG/JPEG2000 with fully preserved Metadata (EXIF and others). We prefer images generated with lossless compression at the camera’s native resolution, or very high quality lossy compression if the workflow doesn’t permit lossless. (see recommendations below)
Archival storage: iDigBio sees the importance of archival storage although currently does not provide any, and hosting of images in iDigBio should not be seen as such. As the current iDigBio NSF agreement does not fund archival storage, within current resource limitations, iDigBio may be able to facilitate storage of images on a case-by-case basis.

Image Archiving Recommendations
Archiving images is strongly recommended and is viewed as an institutional responsibility, governed by institutional policy.
Archived image files should be permanently retained in a secure, redundant environment on institutional infrastructure or commercial back-up services.
Uncompressed DNG is the preferred archival format.
Images captured in proprietary camera RAW format (e.g., CR2, NEF, PEF, etc.) should be converted to Digital Negative format (DNG).
Conversion to DNG can be accomplished via Adobe DNG Converter, available free from Adobe.com, or via Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.
Uncompressed or lossless compressed, unmodified TIFF at 24 bits or higher is an alternative archival format.


Image Derivative Recommendations
JPEG and JPEG 2000 images should be saved at their native dimensions (spatial resolution).
Manually increasing resolution (e.g., alterations to image size or ppi or dpi settings) beyond that recorded by the camera may insert derived data or unwanted visual artifacts into an image file and is not recommended.
EXIF, IPTC, and other image metadata (including JPEG 2000 XML data), including that added at time of processing, should be preserved in perpetuity and distributed with all derivative and distributed copies of images.
Image processing should be carried out only on DNG or other RAW files to prevent accumulated data losses and potential image degradation by repeated processing of JPEG and TIFF image files.
Excessive image manipulation or compositing, including sharpening, enhancing color saturation or balance, and adjusting contrast should be avoided.
